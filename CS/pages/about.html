			<h1> About Captured Memories </h1>
			<p> This webpage is dedicated to all of my memories from the 2022-2023 academic year.
		        Photos are crucial because they allow us to record and preserve moments in time.
		        Photography allows us to see things that might otherwise go unseen. But, most of the time,
				I accidentally erased some of my images, so I decided to create this website named "Captured Memories." 
		        This page has the majority of my photographs taken during my ninth grade year.
			</p>

            <p>Why not just upload it to a drive or something?, the majority of you may ask. 
			However, for some reason, I feel more comfortable doing this because anyone can access it offline, I believe. 
			Additionally, this is solely for my ninth-grade adventures. Because my drive was taking up storage space and 
			I wanted anyone to be able to readily see my enjoyable events, I decided to create this website.
