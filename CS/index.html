					    <h1> Captured Memories </h1>
						<p> This webpage is dedicated to all of my memories from the 2022-2023 academic year. <b>
						Photos are crucial because they allow us to record and preserve moments in time. <b>
						Photography allows us to see things that might otherwise go unseen. <b>
						But, most of the time, I accidentally erased some of my images, so I decided to create this website named "Captured Memories." <b>
						This page has the majority of my photographs taken during my ninth grade year. </p>
